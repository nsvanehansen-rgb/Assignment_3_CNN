# PCAM DenseNet Classification Project

This repository contains a Deep Learning model (DenseNet121) for classifying images from the **PatchCamelyon (PCAM)** dataset.

## Important Note on Data
The PCAM dataset is approximately **20GB** in size. Due to GitHub's file size limits, the data is **not included** directly in this repository.

Instead, we provide a helper notebook (`download_data.ipynb`) that automatically downloads and sets up the data for you.
